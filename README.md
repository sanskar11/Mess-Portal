# Learn php
I have tried to build a very small mess portal in which students can: 
  * add new entry
  * change existing entry
  * remove entry
  
  Database will be diplay below the page.
  
  Database(test3) and table(demo_table1) will be automatically created when it is run for the first time.
  
  To execute change the username and password to your own sql account in dbconfig.php file.
  This is made in php and mysql. I hope you like this.
