# Learn php

We tried to build a Mini Mess Portal in which students can: 
  * add new mess registration
  * change existing mess registration
  * cancel mess registration
  * uncancel mess registration
  
  Database will diplay the mess registration below the page.
  
  Database(test3) and table(demo_table1) will be automatically created when the code is run for the first time.
  
  To execute change the username and password to your own sql account in dbconfig.php file.
  Then run the first.php file to view the webpage on your browser.
  
  This is made in php and mysql. I hope you like this.
